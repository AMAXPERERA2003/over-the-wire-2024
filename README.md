# over-the-wire-2024

Over the wire is a game that can be accessed through the site https://overthewire.org/wargames/ . The walkthrough that is being displayed is bandit which is provided as the first level for a cybersecurity student that can be easily accessed freely and go on level by level.

Bandit is given through a overthewire server;
#### to access the bandit server they give you some rules how to access

But as a first year cybersecurity student it is difficult access the server for the first time, but it is easier if you continue trying.

<h1>You can do it</h1> That's what i thought for myself.
